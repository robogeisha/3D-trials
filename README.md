  3dcube_rotate
 
  This program renders a 3D wireframe cube in the terminal window using ASCII characters.
  It uses basic linear algebra to apply rotation transformations to the cube vertices
  and then projects the 3D points onto a 2D screen. The cube is rotated about the
  x, y, and z axes, and the animation runs in a loop.
